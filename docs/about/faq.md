# FAQ

## Frequently or not frequently asked questions about Project Segfault!

## Who is the project owner?
Orignally: Midou (Sysadmin) and Mrlerien (Hoster), but now Odyssey346 (Game Server Sysadmin, webdev and social media manager) and Devnol (Hoster) are with us.

# Hold on, what if Devnol decides to backstab you?
I highly doubt he will, but in any case this happens, critical services will stay up. So only extra (non important services) running on the server will be gone, but you should be aware of that anyways.

# One of your services contains toxic people!
You can contact us by mail or Matrix and we can figure this out with you. But we recommend that you put most of these requests in our support channel at [#support:projectsegfau.lt](https://matrix.to/#/#support:projectsegfau.lt) on Matrix.
If it's something personal, just say that you have a report against someone on one of our services and you'd like to be contacted by an admin and we'll constact you ASAP. We have no lives so we're quite active.

# How can I trust your services?
Well, you really can't. We don't make our logs or anything public, however, if you would like the data we have on you, look no further than [our Privacy Policy](/wiki/legal/privacy-policy). If you're paranoid, **you are allowed to use Tor on our services**, but we don't host any .onion links.
